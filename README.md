Torrent files I've created to share data.

[btg_psnode_660000_pruned](https://github.com/MentalNomad/torrents/raw/main/btg_psnode_660000_pruned.torrent): a torrent containing all the data for a pruned BTG node, pre-synced up past block 660,000. You can run the BTG Core wallet, download this 2.77 Gig torrent, drop in the files, and be synced up to 660,000 (late 2020) in a flash. See [my forum post](https://forum.bitcoingold.org/t/pre-synchronized-full-node-pruned/5333) for more info.
